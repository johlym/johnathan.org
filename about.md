My name's Johnathan and I'm an Engineer, blogger, and this is my digital home. I started this blog in late 2014 as a place to dump my thoughts and it's transformed a handful of times over the years. I've put down more than 100,000 words into this blog in that time (enough for a handful of books) and have no plans on stopping. Professionally I've done tech support, systems engineering, desktop support, <a href="//github.com/johlym">coding</a> and a variety of other tasks. Day-to-day involves engineering, support, and gifs at Papertrail. I dabbled in the PHPs for a time but my heart will always be with Ruby.

For any inquiries, emails are great: <code>email [at] johnathan dot org</code>. You can also find me on <a href="//twitter.com/_johlym">Twitter</a>.
