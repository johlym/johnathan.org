Sometimes things happen. It&#39;s still Thursday on the Best Coast. Are you really checking your email late at night? You are? I suppose there&#39;s no help for you.<br>
<br>
This week&#39;s picks are good for two reasons:<br>
<br>
1. They&#39;re tasty<br>
2. They&#39;re cheap<br>
<br>
Let&#39;s face it. New Years is one of those times where you&#39;ll&nbsp;either do something you&#39;ll never forget, or forget you did something you&#39;ll&nbsp;never forget because you got blackout drunk and your friend Steve offered to take you home. All the while, you threw up in his car, got angry at his dog, and wondered why your coat smelled like bad nachos.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In the spirit of New Years, let&#39;s do something we&#39;ll remember and pick a couple wines that hit the $10 or under range. You think I&#39;m crazy... good. I&#39;m nuts.<br>
<br>
<strong>#1 -&nbsp;She Knows What She&#39;s Doing</strong><br>
<br>
The first pick of the week is a classic in my book and a go to if I want a little bit of dollars to get me a decent bit of wines. <a href="https://www.ste-michelle.com">Chateau St. Michelle <em>anything</em></a>&nbsp;is a surprisingly good taste-for-the-price wine. You can find this pretty much anywhere wine is sold, across the country, so far as I know, and depending on how close to Washington (where it comes from) you are, most bottles they sell will&nbsp;run anywhere from $7 to $10.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>#2 - It Rolls Down Stairs, Alone or in Pairs, It&#39;s Jug, Jug, Jug</strong><br>
<br>
This next pick will blow your freaking mind. You&#39;ll also think I&#39;m some sort of hack for recommending it. I&#39;m expecting a lot of drinking to take place this weekend so to keep the fountains of adult juice flowing, you&#39;ll need a lot of wine. This is where the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Taylor-Lake-Country-Red-Wine-3-l/23623641">Taylor Lake Country Red Wine</a>&nbsp;from Walmart comes in. It&#39;s $10 and three liter(re)s. It&#39;s also tasty as hell. Give your wine snob friend a taste of this without telling them. If they like it, promptly shame in whatever way you feel appropriate.&nbsp;<br>
<br>

<div style="text-align: center;"><em>(Secret: That&#39;s not a bell, it&#39;s a glass of wine. She&#39;s a pinot fan.)</em></div>

<div><br>
That&#39;s all I have for this week. Tune in next week where I find out how crazy you got because you emailed me a picture of you drinking three liters of wine or mustered the energy and mental focus to tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/_JohnathanLyman">@_JohnathanLyman</a>.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Friends don&#39;t let friends drive drunk. Friends&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;let friends share this email with them and tell them to subscribe.&nbsp;<br>
