As I was deciding what to pick out this week, I realized I&#39;ve been quite partial to the reds. Sure, last week we featured a white resiling from Chateau Ste. Michelle, a classic is everyone&#39;s book. Beyond that, it&#39;s been dark red all the way. That&#39;s why this week&#39;s two picks are both whites and are the epitome of what Weekly Wine is about: affordable <em>and</em>&nbsp;tasty.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>В Cоветской России, вино пьет вас. (In Soviet Russia, wine drinks you.)</strong><br>
<br>
Our first pick is the 2014 Courtney Benham Pinot Gris from the Russian River Valley in Sonoma County, California. Don&#39;t let the location fool you, though. There&#39;s nothing Russian about this bottle. It is light and subtly citrus-y, common for the category. Given its nature, if you turn your wine snob dial up just enough, you might say&nbsp;<em>it has a slight spritz feel to it</em>&nbsp;though in reality, it&#39;s just peppy like the Starbucks barista at 5am. <a href="http://www.wine-searcher.com/find/courtney+benham+russian+pinot+gris/2014/usa">Grab this bottle for about $15</a>.<br>
<br>
<strong>What has three arms and makes funny noises?</strong><br>
<br>
Pick number two comes from Richland, WA. For the geographically inclined, yes, that&#39;s close-ish to a <a href="http://www.hanford.gov">former nuclear production site.</a>&nbsp;Don&#39;t let that deter you because This Riesling from Tagaris Winery will help you forget all about it. It&#39;s a typical riesling in its sweet nature and very smooth. Just like that girl you know: starts off sweet, but too much can lead to problems. I digress. You&#39;ll appreciate this white wine until then end, I&#39;m sure of it. <a href="http://www.wine-searcher.com/find/tagaris+arete+riesling+columbia+valley+washington+usa/1/usa">This bottle can be yours for about $13</a>.<br>
<br>
Keep sending in suggestions. I love them. Thanks for giving me even more of an excuse to spend money on wine :D.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Until next time,<br>
