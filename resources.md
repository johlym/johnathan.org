I combed back through some of my posts and put together a list of the helpful lists and how-tos. 

* Programming
  * [List of sites to learn Ruby on Rails](2016/07/rails.html)
  * [Raspberry Pi stuff](https://johnathan.org/tag/raspberry-pi.html)

It's probably helpful to look at my [post list](/posts.html) and Control-F/Command-F through it.
