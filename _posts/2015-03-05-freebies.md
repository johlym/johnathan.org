Last night while I was browsing [Medium][1], I came across a rather exhaustive list of free things startups can use in one capacity or another. [300 Awesome Free Things][2] covers everything and ended up become its own website: [Freebie.Supply][3].

Freebie.Supply covered Business, Marketing, Design/Code, Productivity, and Learning tools that are essentially 100% free. It’s really quite a great resource to poke through and see what you can take advantage of right now, without having to put out a single penny.

That’s all I have for right now. A busy day is ahead of me. Keep up the good fight and continue working on whatever you’re doing to improve your quality of life.
