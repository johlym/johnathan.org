It’s been a couple weeks since I posted anything substantial, for good reason. Today is one of the first days I’ve had since the beginning of the month to sit down and write, now that the dust is settling. Moving is a big deal and is nothing short of a lot of work. Over the next few days, I’ll be sharing some of my adventures and experiences. After that, I’ll talk about what it’s like for a northwesterner in California, a state that’s had minimal rain since I arrived. I’ll give you a sneak peak: I’m already tan.
