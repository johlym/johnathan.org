You're looking at what I can do in an evening (plus some tweaks after). I've been wanting to move to some sort of WordPress alternative for a while, now, and with the semi-maturity of [Ghost][1], I feel like now's a good time to switch. While I'm not a huge JavaScript/Node.js fan, I did find Handlebars to be extremely easy to grasp.

Please excuse the mess while I clean up. Migrating from WordPress isn't straightforward in any sense.
