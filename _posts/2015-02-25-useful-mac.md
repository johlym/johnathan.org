I came across a cool [new site][1] this morning by way of [John Gruber][2] called [Useful Mac][3]. While still relatively new, you might find the status bar extension of use. Personally, I’m a fan of the [minimal status bar][4] look. If you enjoy the OS X customization scene, too, you’ll enjoy this site as it grows.
