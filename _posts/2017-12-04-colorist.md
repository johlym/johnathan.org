<div class="kg-card-markdown"><p>A couple weeks ago, I snagged an <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro 10.5&quot;</a> on a Black Friday deal. At the time, I had a pretty good idea that I'd end up getting an <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> to go with it.</p><p>Sure enough, just last Friday, I waltzed into an Apple Store at 9PM and bought one.</p><p>The first thing I found myself doing with it is scribbling in Notes.app. Ten minutes later, I downloaded <a href="http://pixiteapps.com/pigment/apple-ipad-pro-pencil.html">Pigment</a> and the rest is history.</p><p>Really, it's not history, but I'm having a blast and am considering opening a section on my site for some of the work I've done. Pigment lets users export in glorious detail (up to 4096px in either direction) so long as they've paid. At $10/month (or $5/month paid yearly), it's not an inexpensive app, but the flow of designs is strong and the current collection is pretty large.</p><p>I've found myself spending several hours at a time just plugging (tapping and stroking?) away at the app and already have a couple pretty cool pieces to show for it.</p><p><a href="http://res.cloudinary.com/johnathan-org/image/upload/pigment_art/flower_2_2017-12-03.jpg"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/johnathan-org/image/upload/c_scale,q_85,w_750/pigment_art/flower_2_2017-12-03.jpg" alt="Flower 2"></a></p><p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/johnathan-org/image/upload/pigment_art/new_york_2017-12-03.jpg"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/johnathan-org/image/upload/c_scale,q_85,w_750/pigment_art/new_york_2017-12-03.jpg" alt="New York"></a></p><p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/johnathan-org/image/upload/pigment_art/flower_1_2017-12-02.jpg"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/johnathan-org/image/upload/c_scale,q_85,w_750/pigment_art/flower_1_2017-12-02.jpg" alt="Fower 1"></a></p><p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/johnathan-org/image/upload/pigment_art/red_sunset_2017-12-03.jpg"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/johnathan-org/image/upload/c_scale,q_85,w_750/pigment_art/red_sunset_2017-12-03.jpg" alt="Red Sunset"></a></p></div>
