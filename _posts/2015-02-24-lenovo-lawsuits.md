from [ArsTechnica][1]:

> San Diego blogger [Jessica Bennett filed a lawsuit][2] in federal court last week, charging Lenovo and Superfish with violating state and federal wiretap laws, trespassing on personal property, and violating California’s unfair competition law. In addition to this, [a Pennsylvania law firm put out a press release][3] on Friday that asked Lenovo customers to participate in a class action lawsuit investigation regarding the presence of Superfish on their computers.
