We all want to be smarter. Thomas Oppong ~~put together a list of 33 Web sites that we all can use to become geniuses~~. (He did, but it was [taken down](https://lumendatabase.org/notices/11700921#))

> “I have no special talent, I am only passionately curious.” – Albert Einstein

A few of my favorites from his list:

1.  ~~University of the People – having educational opportunities that reach beyond online video courses is fantastic.~~
2.  [Coursera][3] – this one is always on every list I make regarding top educational resources.
3.  [Investopedia][4] – knowing more about how the markets work and personal finance can _never_ be a bad thing.
4.  [Mental Floss][5] – great for learning about some of the cooler topics science, culture, and society.
5.  [In a Nutshell][6] – while not technically on the list, this YouTube channel put together by some german graphic artists covers a wide array of topics in a way anyone can understand, with awesome visuals.
6.  [C.G.P. Grey][7] – also not technically on the list, however as an educational YouTube resource, Grey tops that list, if there is one.

~~Check out the rest of Thomas’ list if you’re curious. I recommend you check out every link he listed.~~
