I’m a fan of getting as much as you can for free without breaking the rules.

> Every cloud storage provider has a variety of changing promos that can give you extra storage space, so it’s always worthwhile to keep an ear to the ground. Some of the promotions we mention here may change over time, but they’ll also likely be replaced by something else. Cloud storage providers seem to like giving away space like candy if it means new customers.

Check out the [full article, here][1]! I can speak to the Dropbox bonuses, personally. I have 10GB and didn’t spend a dime to get it.
