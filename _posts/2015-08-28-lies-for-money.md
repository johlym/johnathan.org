<div class="kg-card-markdown"><p>I received an email just a bit ago of the political donation variety. It’s worth mentioning that a few years ago I guess I ended up on a Scott Walker mailing list. I’m not entirely sure how that happened, but it did.</p><p>Before I unsubscribed this morning, I actually read the email and there were two things that stood out to me. First, this:</p><blockquote><p>The governor emailed me early this morning specifically asking for your help before the end of the month.</p></blockquote><p>Did he, now? Does he even know who I am? Given I haven’t given him a dollar in the history of ever, I wonder why he was so interested in me.</p><p>The mass email was a “forward” of the “email” that Scott Walker “sent” via his “iPhone.” I put all those words in quotes because I don’t think it actually happened.</p><p>The second line was amusing, too, and made me chuckle:</p><blockquote><p>Colleen, I’ve been reviewing grassroots leaders in the 98036 zip code and I don’t have Johnathan’s contact info. Will you please send them a message asking for an urgent contribution before the end of the month? We really need them on our team.</p><p>Let me know as soon as you hear from Johnathan.</p><p>Thanks!</p></blockquote><p>So you’re trying to get money from me by making me believe that Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin actually emailed you, citing me, and a zip code I don’t live in, on purpose? Because I’ve given zero dollars, I’m somehow probably good for donating a bunch of cash on short notice?</p><p>Pretty weak, but then again, this is American PoliticsTM for you.</p></div>
