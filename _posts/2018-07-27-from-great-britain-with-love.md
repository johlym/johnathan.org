We're spending a couple weeks in Great Britain, the land mass that makes up Scotland, England, and Wales and two thirds of The United Kingdom. While we're out here, a plethora of tourist attractions are being checked off the list. 

## Part 1: Edinburgh, Scotland

Our first stop on the tour is to one of Scotland's largest cities. At over 500,000 humans in size, it sprawls just enough to have both a small-town and urban-bustle vibe. 

On Day 1, we wandered the downtown streets, stopping at Giles' Cathedral. There's a £2 fee for a "photo permit" which is their way of forcing admittance; they know quite well that tourists will take photos but aren't as likely to enter if there's a cost for admittance. Well played.

Moving on to Day 2, we toured the Edinburgh Castle, walked the length of The Royal Mile, visited the Hollyrood Palace–Queen Elizabeth stays there when she's in Scotland–and toured Scottish Parliament.
