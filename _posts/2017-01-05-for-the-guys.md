<div class="kg-card-markdown"><p>Gentlemen, let’s chat.</p><p>What’s important to you? Do you think you could name a few things that are both a) not generic like <em>food</em> or <em>phone</em> and b) worth talking about to a total stranger?</p><p>Have a hobby or two. No, that’s not good enough. Don’t just have a hobby or two, be passionate about it. If someone (maybe a lady?) asks you what you enjoy doing, you’re destined to fail if you tell them <em>watching TV</em>. Sure, I’ll bet they probably like watching TV too (unless they don’t), but that’s not what they’re looking for, and that’s not the bar you should set for yourself.</p><p>It can anything. I have my own <a href="http://weekly.wine">wine club of one</a>. I love telling folks about it because it’s something I’m passionate about and hell, I love wine. I could say <em>I like wine</em>, but that’s bland. Be like the wine. Be unique. Give her a reason to remember you.</p><p>Your pick up lines aren’t going to save you.</p></div>
