Gentlemen, let’s chat.

What’s important to you? Do you think you could name a few things that are both a) not generic like _food_ or _phone_ and b) worth talking about to a total stranger?

Have a hobby or two. No, that’s not good enough. Don’t just have a hobby or two, be passionate about it. If someone (maybe a lady?) asks you what you enjoy doing, you’re destined to fail if you tell them _watching TV_. Sure, I’ll bet they probably like watching TV too (unless they don’t), but that’s not what they’re looking for, and that’s not the bar you should set for yourself.

It can anything. I have my own [wine club of one][1]. I love telling folks about it because it’s something I’m passionate about and hell, I love wine. I could say _I like wine_, but that’s bland. Be like the wine. Be unique. Give her a reason to remember you.

Your pick up lines aren’t going to save you.
