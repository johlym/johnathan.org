I thought I would use it, I really did. I like [Ghost][1] as a platform but it’s just not where I want it to be, right now. Perhaps in a year or so, I’ll give it another shot with serious intentions.

In other news, the [New Relic][2] agent monitoring sucks up memory like a Dyson vacuum. For an app that literally is doing nothing, New Relic’s NodeJS agent sure seems to look like it’s doing a lot of work.

I’m sorry, I need my RAM back. It’s nothing personal.

Don’t get me wrong, I really like New Relic as a whole. They watch over my PHP environment, nginx and MySQL servers, and my server as a whole on the resource and load level for free. That’s pretty good in my book. Plus, all those agents seem to be playing nice, so they can stay.
