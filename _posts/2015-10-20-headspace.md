<div class="kg-card-markdown"><p>I’m always looking for new an interesting ways to stimulate my brain. I’m also always looking for new ways to clear my head when necessary.</p><p>This is where <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a> comes in. I’ve used Headspace for a total of one day as of this writing and so far, I’m pretty impressed. Only time will tell if it’ll be worth investing money in. After my first session, I did feel a bit more relaxed and “with the program.”</p><p>Headspace is free with a <a href="https://www.headspace.com/buy">premium subscription</a> option. Once you get past the first level, you need to pay, but the price is pretty affordable. Paying monthly will set you back $12.95 each month. If you pay up a year in advance, it drops to the equivalvent of $7.99 a month.</p><p>When you start using Headspace, you’re greeted by a soft spoken gentleman (his name is <a href="https://www.headspace.com/andy-puddicombe">Andy</a>) who first walks you through the process and how Headpsace works. Once you dive in, you’re introduced to your first ten minute session. Find a place where you won’t be bothered. You don’t necessarily have to find a quiet place, as the voiceover will help you take advantage of the noise.</p><p>You can work through the daily meditations on your computer via <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">headspace.com</a> or on their <a href="https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app">mobile app</a> available for <a href="https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app">all major mobile platforms</a>.</p><p>Feel like paying? Subscribing to Headspace opens up a whole host of situation-specific meditations for things like health, mental performance, and even a series on how to improve your meditation game. One category I find the most beneficial is the SOS category of meditations. If you’re working through a troubling situation or are literally freaking out, the SOS option will help you get your head back in the game and bring your mind back down to Earth.</p><p>I won’t give away the rest but I will say that I enjoyed my first Headspace experience. I recommend you give it a shot. I think you’l enjoy it, too.
