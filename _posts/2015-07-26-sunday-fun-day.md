It’s Sunday, and the one thing I enjoy doing on Sunday is watching (American) football. Since it’s still 19 days away from the Seahawk’s first pre-season game–that I might end up missing because I live in California, now, and DirecTV’s NFL Sunday Ticket is both over-priced and only available on DirecTV–I might have to find my way to a Seahawks bar… if they even exist in the Bay Area.

If that doesn’t end up working out, my guess is it’ll be chores and projects… and games. I try to fit in some game time whenever I can because it’s relaxing for me. being able to shut off for a bit and kill some monsters is almost as good as coffee.
