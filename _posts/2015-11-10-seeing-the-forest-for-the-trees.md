<div class="kg-card-markdown"><p>It’s easy to miss the small picture when looking at the big picture. Thinking about what I have ahead of me in terms of the next year at Bloc gives me two thoughts: it’s going to take a long time and it’s easy to not see the forest for the trees.</p><p>Bloc is a long program. It covers a lot of material in great detail. For the un-initiated, it can take quite some time. I’m told that based on my 72-week track, I should be doing five “checkpoints” per week. It’s Tuesday and I’ve killed seven. I know it might not always be like this and the first weeks are always the “yeah let’s do this!” weeks. As time goes on, the sheer size of the program will really start to show itself but the one thing I’ll need to keep in mind is that no matter how many different *things *I still have to do, I need to just focus on one at a time.</p><p>Before I know it, I’ll be done.</p></div>
