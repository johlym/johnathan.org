I discovered some stats from <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/publications/2017/08/mediacloud">a 2016 Harvard study</a> which discussed politics in the social media landscape. It's a good read and worth checking out, but one (actually three partial) things stood out most of all: the political distribution on the open web, social media, and especially Facebok in particular.

Take a look at this graph[^1]:

That's an insane distribution. I believe political discourse belongs on Facebook, but there's a largely over-represented group and just as well an under-represented groupâ€¦ both on the same side.

I can only imagine that with time, the numbers will drift farther left and right still. Perhaps it's time to reconsider Facebook's place in my daily life.
