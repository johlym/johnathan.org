Writing about phone cases is always an interesting task. Everyone's positions are usually subjective. Some buy them for the looks, some for the protection, some for both. Some go without cases most of or all the time. When Anker asked if I wanted a copy of one of their new Karapax cases for the iPhone 7 and 8+, I said yes.

The [Karapax line of cases from Anker][1] are meant to blend good protection without the stupid price tags that come from some other brands like Otterbox. The unit I received was the [Karapax Touch][2], the slim and translucent mobile device enclosure.

In recent weeks, I've operated caseless, but if I was looking for a slim case that "did the job" without looking fancy or trying to act as a fashion statement, I'd have this case on my short list. For less than $10, there's literally no reason why anyone shouldn't give it a shot. The material might not be for everyone and I can imagine the translucency of the black color would be a turn off for anyone not rocking a black phone. Such is life, though; no case will appeal to every individual.

Nevertheless, give it a shot. If you're not a fan, that's ok. I'm sure you'll know someone who would be.
