One thing I always wish I would have paid more attention to when I was younger was coding. I believe my generation is just the start of the potential batch of humans that become masters of writing code and making apps that do random things. My problem is I feel like I’m a bit behind the curve because I didn’t pay as much attention to it nor did I have a solid path to learn code in the first place…

There’s a huge demand for software developers. A lot of these developers went to school for computer science and built up the foundations necessary to be successful in that career. While I’m decent—I could hold my own if I was writing something with HTML/CSS, Python, or PowerShell—I think I would be even better if I had paid more attention. When I was younger, I didn’t care so much about stuff like that. I wasn’t interested in the future. I was interested in girls and just making it through high school. If I had really kept my nose in the books so to speak, I could have gone to a good school and today I would have a CS degree and likely be pretty good in software development.

I know what you’re thinking. Just because I didn’t get a degree doesn’t mean I can’t excel at programming. You’re right. That’s why I’m good with the above languages I cited. I used to be good with PHP, too, but that was before high school and those brain cells rusted out; a lot has changed with PHP but it’s not foreign to me. I use WordPress every day and I can handle my own when reading and understanding code.

## Where to Learn

There are a ton of resources out there to learn to code, some online and others in person. Here’s a good list from what I’ve discovered and personally think are fantastic:

### Online

*   [Code Academy][1]
*   [Code.org][2]
*   [CodeSchool][3]
*   [Khan Academy][4]
*   [Code Avengers][5]
*   [Girl Develop It][6]
*   [Udacity][7]
*   [Treehouse][8]

### In Person

*   ~~The Iron Yard~~
*   Your Local University
*   [CoderDojo][10]
*   [Intel Computer Clubhouse Network][11]

There are a lot more out there, I’m sure, but these are just the ones I’m familiar with. Not all services and locations will offer up the same courses, but I think there’s a good mix of online and in-person resources to get anyone to a good place to start making their own apps.

Once you have a solid foundation, it’s time to experiment and start making stuff. You’re at the point where you won’t get a high-paying software development job just yet, but it’s coming. Here are some ideas and idea lists to get you started:

*   [5 Project Ideas To Help You Learn Programming Faster][12] (Make Use Of)
*   [Ideas for Coding Projects][13] (Code Conquest)
*   [1500+ Coding Project Ideas][14] (Linux Training Academy)
*   [Summer Coding Ideas for 2014][15] (Fedora Project)
*   [List of Beginner Projects][16] (Github)
*   [Five Crucial Projects for Beginners][17] (DaniWeb)

I’ve combed through a lot of these resources myself and have used some of the earlier resources I listed for learning to code. I personally believe that if you have the time and resources to learn in-person, you’ll have a much better time. If you don’t, please don’t fret. You might be surprised by how much you can learn online. If you ever get stuck, the very popular Q&A site for whatever [StackExchange][18] has great sub-sites for various programming languages but their biggest is [StackOverflow][19]. You’ll find an answer there, I’d almost guarantee it. Your problem probably isn’t unique if you’re working on something that may have been done before.

I might have regrets about not learning to code sooner, but it’s also very much not too late to learn. With the amount of free resources, there’s no excuse.

### **Bonus**

There’s an iPad app called ~~Code Academy – Hour of Code~~ that also provides great resources on the basics of development and programming. If you have an iPad and want to learn the fundaments in an hour a day, give it a look. It’s free so you have nothing to lose and no excuse not to do it.
