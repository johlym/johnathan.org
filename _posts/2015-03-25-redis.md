I’m always looking for interesting things I can do to my site and the series underneath if it means providing some sort of benefit, even if just a small one. I also like learning, so I got the best of both worlds when I took the time a few days ago to set up [Redis][1] as a front-end cache for WordPress.

Installing it was dead simple. I already had the PHP [PECL module][2] installed, so all I needed to do was [install it via apt-get][3], install a [WordPress plugin][4], and I’m on my way. It took less than ten minutes. Way cool.

Page loads drops by about half. I like that.
