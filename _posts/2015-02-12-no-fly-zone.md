[This][1] is [good news][2] for fans of privacy.

> Yesterday a new website and database launched called [NoFlyZone.org][3], which invites people to enter their home address to prevent amateur drone pilots from zooming over their property, GoPro running. The database is maintained by a team of 10 people based in El Segundo, California, and led by Ben Marcus, a private pilot and drone operator.

I have a pretty good idea what organizations wonâ€™t be using this database.
