It wouldn’t be a groundbreaking moment in history unless an opposing political party starting whining and groaning and stomping their feet until they get their way.

> US Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) today filed legislation to overturn the [municipal broadband decision][1] the Federal Communications Commission made earlier in the day.

Let’s keep in mind this isn’t net neutrality overall, just the ruling the FCC made regarding a [municipality’s ability to expand][2] outside their designated territory.

If someone didn’t contact, I’d be surprised.

If you want to read the whole act titled “States’ Rights Municipal Broadband Act of 2015,” [here you go][3].
