<div class="kg-card-markdown"><p>Thatâ€™s a fun question, right?Â <em>Youâ€™re upset so while youâ€™re upset, think about why</em>. Thatâ€™s usually not high on the list of <em>Things to Do</em>.</p><p>It probably should be.</p><p>It sounds crazy, but knowing why something is bothersome I think is paramount to understanding it fully. Iâ€™ve found myself employing this tactic a lot over the last year.</p><p>Why am I angry? Why do I think this person will do that thing? Why do I hate mushrooms?</p><p>That last one I already knowâ€“theyâ€™re disgusting, flavorless, spongey, sprouting dirt turdsâ€¦ but hey, I didnâ€™t always have such a wonderful answer. ðŸ™‚</p><p>Mark Manson covers this inÂ <em><a href="http://l.john.ly/tsaongaf">The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</a></em>. He tells the story of <a href="http://l.john.ly/F">Hiroo Onoda</a>, a Japanese soldier that spent almost 30 years in the Philipenes, fighting a war that had ended. He led a pretty terribleÂ life in the jungle but had a clear purpose for it. It was his mission. He was suffering for what he believed was a good cause.</p><p>When we think about why weâ€™re feeling a way about something or why weâ€™re choosing to live in a poor moment, itâ€™s not necessarily a bad thing for it to be a less-than-ieal situation. The key is being alright with it. Onoda accepted the situation he was in so you, too, can accept that Christmas with your in-laws is garbage but you love your wife and she really enjoys spending time with your family. Thatâ€™s actually two reasons!</p></div>
