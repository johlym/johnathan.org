Not too long ago I pitted Linode and Digital Ocean against each other after hearing about Digital Ocean's price slashing that brought it in line with Linode's monthly bills. This got me thinking: only a crazy person would pit seven VPS providers against each other in multiple size categories and see who's the best.

Who has two thumbs and is crazy?

<!--more-->

The name of the game is simple: each provider's VPSes run through the same gauntlet of tests:

* CPU
* Memory Read &amp; Write
* File I/O
* Apache Benchmarks
* MySQL Benchmarks
* Network Speed Test

and one VPS each from a provider's respective 1GB, 4GB, and 8GB is tested. Here's the entire list of providers that'll be tested in this mega ultra VPS benchmark showdown extravaganza:

- AWS
- Azure
- Digital Ocean
- Linode
- Vultr
- Dreamhost
- Lightsail
- OVH
- Atlantic.net

**Better still**, providers that have compute-oriented and high RAM classes are also up against one another in those categories, one from each. Compute-class offerings are those specifically labeled as being for compute-type tasks. Of the basic list of VPS providers being tested, only Digital Ocean and Atlantic.net offer such a thing so it makes sense that we bring in the Tier 1 Heavyweights: AWS and Azure. Compute-class tests will be done on whatever **8-core** offering is provided by each company. In the case of AWS and Azure, we'll use the following instance configurations:

* AWS: `c3.2xlarge`
* Azure: `F8 v2` and `H8`

It's about to be a party. I look forward to writing this mega post in the coming weeks. If you have an iead for a host you'd like to see in this test, comment below. My original Linode v. Digital Ocean post got a decent amount of traction and folks seemed to enjoy it so why not shoot for the moon, yeah?
