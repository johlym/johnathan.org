**Update May 12, 2018**: This app is no longer available. I've removed links to it but kept the post for posterity. 

One thing I’m working on is improving my software development skills. In 2015, along with everything else, I want to be much better at programming and development. One tool I used when I first started, and revisited again last night, was [CodeAcademy on the iPad][1]. A great app that teaches you the super basics so other languages don’t seem so daunting. It’s free, and anyone can use it. Give it a whirl and [download it from the App Store][2]. I mentioned it was free, right?

When you’re done, visit their [full site][3] and start learning more advanced stuff. If you’re totally new to coding, start with [HTML][4]. In this day and age, it never hurts to know it. If you’ve already been through all of their stuff and want more, check out the post I wrote not too long ago listing other great sources for learning to code.
