What’s the point of having ad blocking software if it doesn’t block any ads? Good question.

[From the Verge][1]:

> Some of the web’s biggest companies have been paying to get around Adblock Plus, according to [a new report from _Financial Times_][2]. Microsoft’s Bing search ads and [Taboola’s “recommended links” box][3] are among the ads that are currently slipping through Adblock Plus’s filter, and _FT_ confirms that it’s the intentional result of a paid deal between the makers of Adblock and the owners of the ads.

Sweet.
