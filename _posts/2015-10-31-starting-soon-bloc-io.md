<div class="kg-card-markdown"><p>I officially signed up last week for <a href="http://Bloc.io">Bloc.io</a>’s Full-stack developer bootcamp becuase I feel while I can learn a good deal of stuff on my own, I’m not going to make on my own to the level I need to be in order to make a fundamental career shift to software development that will actually still support my family.</p><p>The program doesn’t officially start until the 9th of November so I have a little over a week to go. It’ll be a long year and change and a lot of new stuff will come my way. I’ve only scratched the surface of what Ruby and Rails can do. I started a simple Rails app a couple days ago that could one day turn into the platform for any and all of my sites, if I stick to it, enough. Right now, I don’t know enough on how to make it great.</p><p>With time, I will, and as I progress the app will improve. My goal is to one day have it replace WordPress as my blog, portfolio of work, and anything else about me I feature online. I may even adapt it to restart my photography portfolio.</p><p>I’m really looking forward to what I’ll be learning in the coming months and I’ll be sure to share all of it with you.</p></div>
