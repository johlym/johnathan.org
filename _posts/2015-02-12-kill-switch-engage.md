One of the biggest “duh” technologies that we got in the last year or two was the phone kill switch. Lose your phone? Nuke it from orbit. Phone stolen? Nuke it from orbit. Jealous ex texting you at 3am? If you know their Apple ID password, nuke it from orbit.

From [Reuters][1]:

> Thefts involving smartphones have declined dramatically in three major cities since manufacturers began implementing “kill switches” that allow the phones to be turned off remotely if they are stolen, authorities said on Tuesday.

That’s great. Now if only there was some way to educate the remaining group of individuals responsible for stealing phones anyway.
