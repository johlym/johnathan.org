Social media is all around us at this point. It’s hard to avoid a conversation or an interaction with someone without it involving some sort of social media communication. One could argue that it’s the more current version of email, text messaging, and letter writing of days, decades, and centuries past, sure. I’m not entirely sure where I stand on it. I enjoy checking things out on Facebook, I [post my photography][1] to Instagram, I [tweet][2]… but I enjoy a good face-to-face conversation, too…
