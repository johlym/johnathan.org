Have you ever seen such a great [story about a bridge][1]? Neither have I. At roughly ten minutes in length, Lightning Boy Studio comes at us with a great animated tale with no speaking on two men who were determined to fix or rebuild a bridge that had fallen away into a vast canyon. A couple years ago, this video was a [Kickstarter campaign][2] that passed its goal by 5x. Letâ€™s not forget there are a few feels, too.
