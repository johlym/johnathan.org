<div class="kg-card-markdown"><p>This is a statistic I never though I’d reach.</p><p>Yesterday I crossed the 100,000 word mark for all the posts I’ve written on this blog. From <a href="https://johnathan.org/2014/09/photograph.html">the very first on September 9th, 2014</a>, to yesterday, 100,337 words have been written and published. I’m sure I crossed that mark earlier, but since I removed a few posts a couple months ago, the real count didn’t touch this level until <a href="https://johnathan.org/2017/02/special-snowflakes.html">yesterday’s post</a>.</p><p>I’m quite excited to have come this far and look forward to what I come up with for the next 100,000 words. I’d also like to give a quick thank you to <a href="http://john.do">John Saddington</a> for his inspiration to blog regularly. He’s been at it <a href="https://john.do/every-single-day/">for over fifteen years</a> and while I don’t quite have the regularity he does, I still feel I’ve accomplished something great.</p><p>To give you an idea of the scale <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_count">using book types</a>:</p><ul><li>Children’s chapter book: 16,000</li><li>Typical mystery novel: 60-80,000</li><li>Typical “thriller”: 100,000+</li></ul><p>Quite amazing.</p></div>
