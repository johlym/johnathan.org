This is a statistic I never though I’d reach.

Yesterday I crossed the 100,000 word mark for all the posts I’ve written on this blog. From [the very first on September 9th, 2014][1], to yesterday, 100,337 words have been written and published. I’m sure I crossed that mark earlier, but since I removed a few posts a couple months ago, the real count didn’t touch this level until [yesterday’s post][2].

I’m quite excited to have come this far and look forward to what I come up with for the next 100,000 words. I’d also like to give a quick thank you to [John Saddington][3] for his inspiration to blog regularly. He’s been at it [for over fifteen years][4] and while I don’t quite have the regularity he does, I still feel I’ve accomplished something great.

To give you an idea of the scale [using book types][5]:

*   Children’s chapter book: 16,000
*   Typical mystery novel: 60-80,000
*   Typical “thriller”: 100,000+

Quite amazing.
