It’s pretty much impossible to design a site without CSS these days. It controls everything. CSS has a hand in so many visual aspects of a site that it can get daunting to keep track of it all or figure out how to tweak it just a certain way. I came up with a list of various web-based CSS tools that can assist any designer in their front-end development quest. If there’s something I missed, please add it to the comments!

### Rocket

[Rocket][2] Helps you create animations for items that move from point A to point B on a page. Just include rocket.css and rocket.js on your page.

### Font Library

[![fontlibrary](/assets/images/2015/07/fontlibrary.png?resize=525%2C333&ssl=1)][3]

Use [Font Library][4] to tag and organize Google fonts. If you’re looking for a font that fits a certain feel, this could come in handy.

### StyleStats

[![stylestats](/assets/images/2015/07/stylestats.png?resize=525%2C333&ssl=1)][5]

Have StyleStats check out your CSS and give you an overview of its qualities including size, unique font sizes, all colors listed, etc.

### CSS Shrink

[![cssshrink](/assets/images/2015/07/cssshrink.png?resize=525%2C333&ssl=1)][6]

Unless your regular shrink who charges $300 an hour, [this guy][7] does his work for free, slimming down your CSS and removing un-necessary code.

### CSS Beautifier

[![beautifier](/assets/images/2015/07/beautifier.png?resize=525%2C333&ssl=1)][8]

Take your ugly, unformatted CSS and [turn it into a masterpiece][9].

### Spin Kit

[![loadicon](/assets/images/2015/07/loadicon.gif?resize=525%2C295&ssl=1)][10]

I could stare at them all day, and nothing’s ever going to load. [Spin Kit][11] is your source for CSS loading icons.

### PX to EM conversion

Math is hard. [PX to EM][13] will take care of the number crunching for you. Enter your original size and required size and it’ll math it up and give you an EM equivalent.

### Type Scale

[![typescale](/assets/images/2015/07/typescale.png?resize=525%2C333&ssl=1)][14]

How big is that font? [It’s big][15]. How big is the next size up? Bigger.

### The SVG Font Machine

[![svgfont](/assets/images/2015/07/svgfont.png?resize=525%2C333&ssl=1)][16]

Turn your SVG icons into [a usable font][17].

### Fontello

[![fontello](/assets/images/2015/07/fontello.png?resize=525%2C333&ssl=1)][18]

Take icon sets from the known joints like Font Awesome and [turn them][19] into a font.
