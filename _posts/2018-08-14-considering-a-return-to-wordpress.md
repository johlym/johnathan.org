Over the last few weeks, I've mulled over in my mindâ€“several times, in factâ€“going back to WordPress for the simple reason that a static site, while fast and relatively secure, it hard to scale. It's also a bit more difficult than I would like to post on a regular basis. I enjoy Forestry a lot, actually, but I'd rather use tools like MarsEdit, something I can't do right now. 

Updates to posts require multiple steps and as my post count grows, it just gets more out of control. 

What's holding me back at the moment is creating a WordPress theme (again). I didn't really enjoy doing it the first time around. ðŸ˜‚
