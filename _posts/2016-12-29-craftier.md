<div class="kg-card-markdown"><p>I was looking back and some old posts earlier this morning, and came across one <a href="https://johnathan.org/give-it-up/">talking about the iPhone or some such</a>.</p><p>There was a specific line (and corresponding photo) that I included which amused me more than it should have. At the time, I don’t know if I found it all that funny, but now… I really did lol.</p><p>What did I say that was so hillarious?</p><blockquote><p>You can tell a lot about a time period by whether you have a cat that’s willing to loiter around artillery.</p></blockquote><p>Tell me that’s not comedy gold.</p><p>Ok fine, it’s not.</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>I don’t need your opinion anyway.</p><p>I can write good.</p><p>Ish.</p><p>The moral of this lame story is this: when you don’t specifically try to be entertaining… that’s when you’re entertaining.</p></div>
