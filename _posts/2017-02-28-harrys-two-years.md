I donâ€™t usually talk about my razor. Iâ€™m thinking todayâ€™s a good day to change that.

A little over [two years ago][1], I wrote about [Harryâ€™s][2]. They touted shaving products that donâ€™t break the bank. Since then, Iâ€™ve used their products almost exclusively and am still a happy customer. I thought Iâ€™d share a bit of their story and how Harryâ€™s came to be.

And ladies: you can use [Harryâ€™s][3] too. ðŸ˜‰

Iâ€™m still such a fan, that even two years later Iâ€™m creating my own product shots (just like I did in 2015; the header image).
