I caught an article this morning from [Esquire][1] talking about the writer’s experiences with [InvisibleGirlfriend.com][2].

> No matter what I asked, Zoe always had a logical response. If she didn’t, she expertly skirted the question. Sometimes her texts were ominous, sometimes oddly detailed. She was always in a good mood. She didn’t mind if I ignored her for hours, though she always responded to me within minutes. She never texted first. If I didn’t initiate that day’s conversation, we simply didn’t talk.

LOL… 🙁

I kept reading the article and came to an odd conclusion: there really is something out there for everyone. At the same time, I became a little sad. The somethings out there for “everyone” include people behind a wall getting paid per text to have small talk with someone. Ten bucks says Zoe, the woman the author highlights in the article, looks nothing like her picture.
